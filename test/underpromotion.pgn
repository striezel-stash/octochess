{ This is an interesting chess puzzle composed by Mark Liburkin in 1933.  He won first prize for this composition. } 1.Ne4+ { Before white can do anything, he must relieve Black's threat of 1... c1=Q# and 1...Be5 and 2... Kd2# } 1...Kd3 2.Nc5+ Kc3 3.Nb3 Be5 { Black threatens mate with his bishop. } 4.f4 Bg7 5.e8=N { The only move.  The black bishop must be under attack. } ( 5.e8=Q c1=Q+ 6.Nxc1 Kc2+ 7.Bd4 Bxd4# ) 5...Bh8 6.f5 { We see yet another point behind 4. f4 and 5. e8=N.  The bishop's check can be relieved via pawn to f6. } 6...Be5 7.Bh2 { White sacrifices his bishop to lure black momentarily from the a1-h8 diagonal, which will give him just enough time to promote his b-pawn.  This is an example of a Decoy. } 7...Bxh2 8.b7 Be5 { Renewing the threat of mate.  A queen promotion leads to stalemate. } 9.b8=B ( 9.b8=Q Kc4+ 10.Qxe5 c1=Q+ 11.Nxc1 { Stalemate. } ) 9...Bxb8 10.Nc7 { Another sacrifice.  This Knight move is an example of two additional tactical themes, interference (White's Knight temporarily interferes with Black's returning his bishop to e5) and vacating/clearing a square (White removes his Knight from e8 to hasten promotion of yet another e-pawn). } 10...Bxc7 11.e7 Be5 12.e8=R { A third underpromotion.  Once again, a Queen promotion leads to stalemate. } ( 12.e8=Q Kc4+ 13.Qxe5 c1=Q+ 14.Nxc1 { Stalemate. } ) 12...Bf6 13.Re6 Bg7 14.f6 { The battle of threat and counterthreat is finally over.  Black has no way of renewing the mating idea on the long diagonal, and White will win thanks to his extra material. }
