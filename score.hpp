 * The score object represents evaluations score. It can be used for partial evaluations
 * as well as complete positional evaluations.
 *
 * The score is being represented by two shorts, one for middle-game and one for end-game
 * evaluation. This distinction is necessary as the evaluation terms are a lot different
 * between game phases.
 *
 * For the search it becomes necessary to extract a single value from the composite score.
 * This value is scaled between the middle-game and end-game score based on the material
 * still on the board.
